# What is LUG?

It is a group of people with the skills, potential and the determination to be the best at what they do. It is a community built to learn, grow, progress and achieve your maximum potential.

#### Why LUG?

#### Be a part of *The Elite*

We bring together the best minds to achieve the best they can.  
Be the one who push the limits of their field.  
Every one of the members become the best of the best. 

#### Learn from *The Best*

Want to pick up a skill and work on it? Someone in the club will probably already know it.  
Reach out and ask for their guidance. With a helpful and tight-knit community, you most certainly will get the help you seek.

With regular internal workshops and resources shared, there is plenty to learn and many fields to explore. Got a skill you want to showcase and teach, take the stage and share!

#### Find your team

Have a senior who you really want to work with or some members you want to participate in events with? Make your team and pick a guide from your seniors to help you at events.

Form your own hackathon and CTF teams from within the club, collaborate and compete in external competitions.  
Get to collaborate and learn with seniors while attending events! We mix and match teams so you can find your perfect teammates.

#### Learn from first principles

Want to re-invent the wheel with good reason? Go ahead! We're not afraid to challenge the underlying, and are not afraid to question abstraction.

Want us to prove it?

- We built our own [CTF platform](https://github.com/lugvitc/pwncore) while so many great platforms exist out there.
- We host our own [hub](https://hub.lugvitc.net), [git](https://git.lugvitc.net), [meet platform](https://meet.lugvitc.net), [cloud collaboration platform](https://cloud.lugvitc.net), and [forum](https://forum.lugvitc.net) while others use Microsoft Teams and Google Meet to simplify their work. We don't mind learning a thing or two trying things our way.
- We're one of the very few teams to conduct dynamic CTF challenges. Just because others don't do it doesn't stop us from trying.

If this suits your vibe we might be made for each other after all!

#### Follow best practices

#### And sometimes learn from hacky fixes

Nothing teaches you what NOT to do than that last minute code change that your peer insta-approved.  
You're provided with the breathing room to goof around and find out.

#### ~~Take initiative~~

~~Have an idea for a project but need help making it a reality? Pitch it in the club and bring it into the world. Bored of the same old hackathons and ctfs and want to do something cool for a change? You have the team and the support you might need. Looking for a team for a competition but don't know people who know how to build? You got the people who will help you out.~~

#### And if not all this, then...

Why not just shoot your shot? You miss 100% of the shots you don't take üòâ

# FAQs

#### Full form of LUG?

Linux Users Group

#### Is LUG only for Linux users?

Although it has Linux in the name, LUG doesn't strictly stand for Linux. Linux is just a common software that beautifully defines us:

- It's free and open-source
- It teaches you a lot about tech as a whole
- Lets you re-invent the wheel (sometimes for good reasons, other times, not really üòÖ)

#### What if I'm not a Linux user?

No issues! As long as you're keen to learn, grow, and contribute, it doesn't matter what operating system you use.

But trust me, no one has survived the Linux flu üòè

#### Can I join if I'm not from VIT Chennai?

Unfortunately we cannot accept members outside of VIT Chennai.  
You can still participate in our events and workshops without having to be from VIT Chennai üòÑ 

#### Which other technical clubs should I join in VIT Chennai?

IEEE Computer Society is pretty dank üëÄ
